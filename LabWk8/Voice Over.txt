Lab Wk8

Q1

Ran SQL to cover Q1 and Q2
- Got Age - character conversion to date;
- built up agregation in SQL for graph 1

- Graph - used a facet wrap for the multiple bar charts
- Graph - used some themes and labelling from some external research
- Chose a different track for other questions because of presentation/format issues



Q2

- Using same average marks from Q1
- Line chart with points
- Single row facet wrap seemed a better option for visual comparison


Q3

- if I was doing this again I would run this in a loop but I did SQL/facet wrap for each student.
- Did this before I looked at the next lab so I pivoted the dataset using pivot_longer function
- Bar Chart plot is like the starting exercise in the next lab - bars of written and oral side by side.
- Single row facet wrap for each student for year/subject
- Chose different colours for each student.
- At some point everyone has done better in written than oral. 




Q4

- Set up SQL for averages
- Ordered barchart with label
- Coloured by subject




Q5

- Set Up Sql again for aggregations
- Another ordered bar chart with labels
